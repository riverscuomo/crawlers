# Crawlers [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://makeapullrequest.com)

An experimental project to combine 2 or more poetry packages into a single repo.
These are scrapers for various music streaming services. they use python selenium.
I doubt this repo will be of any use to anyone else, but feel free to chime in.
`spotifycrawler` and `lastmcrawler` draw on common code in `core`.
They scrape data from spotify and lastfm respectively, and then use `gspread` to import the data into google sheets.

I use these crawlers to populate https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10kY2Ti0Gn0jfx92uY0vVntZoJdNTywxKuOfriDoywC0/edit#gid=624343020
From there I make setlists for Weezer shows.

## Installation

Depending on which functions you want to run, you will need the following environment variables:
